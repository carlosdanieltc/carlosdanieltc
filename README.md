###  Hello there! 🚀
I'm *github_account_name!*

Just kidding, I'm ***Carlos**, a experienced Frontend developer currently working at* **Minsait**!

 - 👷‍♀ I’ve finished my higher DAM studies. Then, I’ve focused on frontend development, that it’s the most I like it.
 - 🤖 I haven’t got experience about it, but I'm very interested in working in projects associated to *AI* or *VR*.
 - 📝 I really enjoy the process of designing and structuring a product before coding it!
