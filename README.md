###  Hello there! 🚀
I'm *github_account_name!*

Just kidding, I'm Carlos, an experienced software developer passionate about building scalable and efficient solutions!

 - 👷‍♀ I’ve completed my higher DAM studies and have been diving deep into software development ever since, exploring both frontend and backend technologies.
 - 🤖 I haven’t got experience about it, but I'm very interested in working in projects associated to *AI* or *VR*.
 - 📝 I really enjoy the process of designing and structuring a product before coding it!
